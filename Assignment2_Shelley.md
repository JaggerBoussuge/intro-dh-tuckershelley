## Topic Modeling Visualization

## Writeup

The data I chose for modeling topics is the corpus of 800 different journal entries from the Journal of Popular Music. I pulled articles dating back to 1981 and up to 2013. After some deliberation I decided to make 25 different topics. I didn't want to go any lower than that for fear of not having enough range of topics. However, with only 800 bodies of writing, I was slightly restricted with respect to number of topics. I attempted upping the number of topics up to 30, but some of them became too convoluted and farfetched. These topics really tell us a nice story of how popular music works in the world. It is apparent that the most popular genres are pop, hip hop, blues and jazz because those are the only ones that really have their own topics. It is clear that America is the leader in popular music around the world. It has multiple topics on music in America, while other areas of the world are either lightly represented or not at all. That could also be due to the journal being written by mainly Americans. Some of the most insightful topics are the ones that are about music in the world. There are topics dedicated to sales, broadcasting, societal views, and the culture. These describe not the music itself but what work the music does and why it's made. Another significant topic is "Sexuality" due to its ability to describe popular music. Everyone knows that sex sells, but does gender? This topic goes deeper than just sex and shows how gender is a huge topic in popular music. "It is distant reading in the most pure sense" (Weingart and Meeks, JDH, Winter 2012). This really sums up topic modeling and its ability to do work in the humanities. It allows us to look at massive corpuses of writing and draw conclusions about the purpose and the heart of that corpus. However, as they stated later, this prompts a movement from interpreting the language for what it is to interpreting whole topics (Weingart and Meeks, JDH, Winter 2012). A big drawback of this is it relies so much on the methods used to make the model. Things like number of iterations and topics can lead someone to draw conclusions that wouldn't be drawn if the corpus was close read.
