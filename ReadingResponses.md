#### Text analysis of Trump Tweets:

I found it really interesting that they thought to compare the times of the tweets with each other. I knew Trump liked to tweet in the early hours of the day, but I would never think that it's a different person tweeting in the afternoon. One question I have is, if it isn't Trump writing these tweets, who is? Are there methods we could use to compare these tweets with writing from other White House officials?

#### Data Miners Dig for Answers:

I found it strange that in order to see who was influencing the book more, they looked at "function" words like "the" "that" etc. I figured that they would look more at things like topics. This brings me to question what this has to do with topic modeling. Do they use similar methodology when comparing word counts? Are the probability equations similar? Do they treat these "function" words almost like a topic?
