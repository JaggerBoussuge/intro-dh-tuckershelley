Since as long as I can remember, I have been enthralled with music. Therefore, I decided to take a look at the top song on the Billboard Hot 100 list. My main goal of looking at this was to see whether or not the length of the top songs changed as time went on. It turns out that other than the two short songs in the '50s, they were all pretty similar. I imagined that songs would get longer as time went on as the mp3 players and iPods were invented and the radio became less popular. I also wanted to take a look at the genres and labels and see if there was one that was more prominent. According to the data, naturally, pop is the most frequent genre. Columbia records is the most frequently represented record label. My source is the Billboard Hot 100 webpage.
