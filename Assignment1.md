Since as long as I can remember, I have been enthralled with music. Therefore, I decided to take a look at the top song on the Billboard Hot 100 list. Popular music says a lot about the culture that it originates from. My main goal of looking at this was to see whether or not the length of the top songs changed as time went on. I wanted to see how our musical attention spans have changed throughout the years. I figured that songs would get longer as time went on as the mp3 players and iPods were invented and the radio became less popular. Songs on the radio would have to be quick because people don't choose what is played. However, when people can choose a song they like, they may be mofe inclined to listen to a longer song. As it turns out, there wasn't much of a pattern of songs getting longer. The two songs from the '50s were shorter, but after that, the songs all fluctuated with no apparent pattern. I also wanted to take a look at the genres and labels and see if there was one that was more prominent. According to the data, naturally, pop is the most frequent genre. Columbia records is the most frequently represented record label. My source is the Billboard Hot 100 webpage. My variables are as follows.
* Year is a date number variable. It is the year in which the song was at the top of the charts, not necessarily the year it was released
* Artist is a string category variable describing the artist of the song in question
* Song is a string category variable describing the name of the song in question
* Release date is a date number variable that describes the date that the song was released. I couldn't find the exact release dates on some of the really older ones so I put either the first of the month or year
* Rank is a number variable describing where the song landed on the year end Billboard Hot 100 list
* Song Length is a number variable describing the length of the song. The radio edit was used if that was shorter than the original, since that is what became famous, most likely
* Record Label is a string category variable that is the name of the record label under which the song was released
* Genre is a string category variable that describes the genre of the song
